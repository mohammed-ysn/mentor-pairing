# Mentor Pairing

This program, developed for the Cambridge University Islamic Society, is designed to pair potential mentors with mentees.

## Pairing Process

1. The program reads data from CSV files for mentors and students.
2. It pairs students with mentors based on their career interests and requested forms of help. The number of students assigned to a mentor does not exceed their maximum specified number.
3. Unassigned students and/or mentors are handled at the end.
4. The final pairings are exported to a CSV file.
